I am a third-year Ph.D. student majoring in computer science at Texas A&M University. I am supervised by Dr. Theodora Chaspari in [HUman Bio-Behavioral Signals (HUBBS)](https://hubbs.engr.tamu.edu/) Lab.  

I have a broad interest in affective computing, signal processing, and deep learning.  I am currently working towards applying machine learning models to real-world human-related data. This derives in two directions: 1) addressing challenges specifically for human data (e.g., interpersonal difference); and 2) increasing the transparency of the system (e.g., applying knowledge-driven methods) to gain trust from the human users, especially in the health-care field. For more information, please check my [Research](/research/),  [Publication](/publications/), or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LmPz0PQAAAAJ&hl=en) page.  

If you want to pronounce my name, it sounds like "Cauchy". I also go by Kevin for convenience.  

These topics are great to start a casual conversation with me:
- My cat
- General fitness goals - as I am an ACE-certified personal trainer
- Powerlifting - as a subpar lifter, I am always ready to challenge myself with a heavier weight. [Here](https://vimeo.com/749962170) is my squat on a random training day
- Switch games. Shhh, don't tell my advisor I have spent tons of hours on that (TâŒ“T)
- Travel - I have been to California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Florida.
