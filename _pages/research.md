My research interests mainly focuse on affective computing, signal processing, and deep learning. My goal is to build reliable and interpretable deep learning systems that can be applied in real-world scenarios. I am / have been working on the following exciting research topics:

**1. Design machine learning systems to address the varies challenges (e.g., label scarcity, domain shift, label base rate difference) for human-related data**  
	**K. Feng**, J. B. Duong, K. Carta, S. Walters, G. Margolin, A. C. Timmons, T. Chaspari, “A Semi-supervised Few-shot Learning Approach With Domain Adaptation for Personalized Stress Detection Within Dating Couples,” submitted to ICASSP 2023.

**2. Knoweledge driven deep learning models to potentially help the clinical mental disorder diagnose**  
	**K. Feng** and T. Chaspari, “Toward Knowledge-Driven Speech-Based Models of Depression: Leveraging Spectrotemporal Variations in Speech Vowels,” IEEE International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI 2022), Ioannina, Greece, September, 2022.

**3. Data mining and analysis for social emotions**  
	**K. Feng**, P. Zanwar, A. Behzadan, and T. Chaspari, “Exploring Speech Cues in Web-mined COVID-19 Conversational Vlogs,” *ACM Multimedia-2020 workshop on Media Analytics for Societal Trends (MAST 2020)*, October 2020, DOI: 10.1145/3423268.3423584
